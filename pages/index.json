        "description": "Testifai is a web application that allows users upload their class notes or study material and recieve stuctured tests back. It uses NLP and a fine-tuned model to generate questions from their knowledge base. This project required technical prowess in React, Node, Python, MongoDB, and I needed to learn how to finetune a LLM to my specific educational usecase and how to use heroku to deploy the server-side.",

        "description": "Ounje is a project that I have a deep commitment with. It is mobile application that allows users to generate recipes based on pictures of their fridge. While undertaking this project, I had to constantly search for alternative solutions and tech stacks to solve the problems I encountered, such as using a pre-trained model to identify food items in images. I had to commit to learning tools like React Native to build the app, Expo to deploy and test it, and Supabase for authentication and database management.",

				"title": "How Behavioral Economics Informs Effective Market Strategies",
				"description": "A personal thesis where I put traditional economic models and assumptions about rational actors to the side. I employed the concepts of behavioural economics and its primary focus on the irrationality of its agents to explain the market strategies of firms. I used the concepts of loss aversion, anchoring, and the endowment effect to explain the strategies of unicorn firms and startups. This project required a deep understanding of the concepts of behavioural economics and the ability to apply them to real-world scenarios.",
